Every word that lives in this dictionary is friends with many of the other words.  All kinds of the words hang out together.  Sometimes they go to the zoo.  Sometimes they go fishing.  It just depends.  Some of the words like dogs and cats; others prefer to ride horses when they get a chance.  One of the words is married to an egret.  She is a word that is married to a bird.  Valentines day is a big deal for them.  Love, love, love, it is everywhere on that day.  Halloween is also fun.  Many of them have random thoughts and because of that sing lots of songs to with strange lyrics.  It is a very interesting and unique dictionary. Praise the Chair.
